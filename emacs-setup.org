* What, when and how is loaded.
The preferred but not reached state is:
- General things reflecting my org preferences should be set in the custom.el file. There are some (when I get to it documented) preferences in [[emacs:default-custom.el][default-custom.el]] that can be merged with or saved to proper customer file by loading the form and saving customizations [[elisp:customize-save-customized]]. As custom.el is supposed to be under git, unwanted changes can be reverted easily.
- Additional functions should be in autoload or local sections with their =(eval-after-load 'org (bind-key ...))= nearby
- Core functions such as  language, enabling disabled commands and removing some decorations is in init.el
- Lit of files with autoload can be reached by elisp:tz-list-experimental-snippets

* Current setup - init file
The init file sets up expected environment

** General setup of core functions

** Prodigy                                                     :experimental:
- Used to start network functions
- Not best match as killing requires root priviledges
- Does not make sense on Windows


* Testing
Run =tz-start-emacs-tests= to start new emacs and make few tests with "screenshots" in html. The screenshots are stored in the tests directory managed by git to be able to detect and view changes (otoh, changes to agenda content are not so relevant to be gited).

* Org mode setup

** Overview

Several files:
| File          | Purpose                                   | Agenda? |
|---------------+-------------------------------------------+---------|
| weekly-review | More or less actual tasks                 | Y       |
| projects      | Projects (project per heading)            | N       |
| knowledgebase | Customer independent reusable information | N       |
| <topic>       | Long-term projects                        | N       |

- all these files are refilable, only some part of agenda
- Current workflow:
  + Captures go to the weekly review file
- The setup differs on work Windows machine and Linux machines
